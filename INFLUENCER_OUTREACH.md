Subject: New AI Research Assistant That Could Transform Document Analysis

Dear [Name],

I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I'm reaching out because I believe you might be interested in Prism AI, a new artificial intelligence tool that we've developed to transform how people interact with documents.

Prism AI is an intelligent document query system that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate answers based on your documents. Simply upload your PDFs, DOCX, or PPTX files and ask questions - Prism AI will find the relevant information and provide concise answers with sources.

What makes Prism AI particularly unique is our seamless integration with M-Pesa, allowing users in Kenya and other African markets to upgrade to premium features using mobile payments - something we haven't seen in other document analysis tools.

Key features include:
- Simple document upload for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files
- Smart question answering with source citations
- Secure and private processing
- M-Pesa mobile payments integration
- Usage-based pricing with free tier

We're launching Prism AI soon and would love to get your thoughts or potentially feature it in your publication. I'd be happy to provide you with early access, a demo, or answer any questions you might have.

Would you be interested in learning more?

Best regards,
